# Wine-Quality-Prediction
This project aims to determine which features are the best quality red wine indicators and generate insights into each of these factors to our model's red wine quality.

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Description Of The Model
### Understand and Visualize Data
To see which variables are likely to affect the quality of red wine the most, I ran a correlation analysis of our independent variables against our dependent variable, quality. This analysis ended up with a list of variables of interest that had the highest correlations with quality.

### Training the Model
The dataset is splitted as 80% for training set and 20% for test set. Random forest algorithm is used in the model.
